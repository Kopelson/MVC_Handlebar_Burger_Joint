# MVC Handlebar Burger Joint

This is a burger logger that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. This project follows the MVC (model, view, controller) design pattern. Models that frame MySQL queries to grab data out of the database. The controller uses a Node Express server to handle each route to and from the user and database. Views uses Handlebars to generate the HTML. MVC Handlebar Burger Joint is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the burger list also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page to the devoured list. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
